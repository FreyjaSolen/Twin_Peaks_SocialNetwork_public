# SocialNetwork in style "Twin Peaks"

This is a simple social network that helps me learn new technologies and programming languages.
In the first release (commit Version1 or Release1), I'm learning React at the best course of IT-KAMASUTRA on YouTube. I added some of my own and learned the hooks by myself. I also made a design in the style of a cult series from the 90s.
Because I use the API, which was kindly provided by the author of the channel, so far users do not always look like city dwellers :).
